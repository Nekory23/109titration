# 109titration

# {EPITECH} | First year | Math project

The benzoic acid is used in industry as a food preservative under the E220 code. It is a white silky-looking
solid. To determine the concentration of this additive in a soda, one can realize a pH titration: a strong base
(the titrant) is progressively added to a sample of the soda (the analyte), and pH is then read.

The generated curve is typical, and has an area where pH brutally increases: it is the pH-jump.

To find the concentration of preservative in the soda, the volume of added titrant at the equivalence point
(ie at the middle of the pH-jump) must be read. There are two main approaches to do so:

  - the derivative method, which consists in calculating the derivative of the curve; the equivalence point matches with the maximum of this derivative
  - the parallel tangents method, which consists in drawing two parallel tangents from one part and another of the pH-jump, then to draw a third straight line equidistant from the two first. The equivalence point is at the intersection between this last line and the curve.
